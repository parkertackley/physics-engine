## [Aug 12 2025 3:30PM] - Particle physics and first demo (sort of)

### What I worked on
- Read up into chapter 4 of Ian Millingtons Book on Game Engine Physics
- Implemented single particle physics
- Started the fireworks demo as presented in the book

### Challenges / Issues
- Currently no graphical display; purely a text based engine at this point
- Trouble understanding some of the math due to no prior vector math exposure

### Next Steps
- Finish chapters 4/5
- Implement corresponding code
- Create a simple renderer to showcase the firework display

### Notes
- Study physics equations more deeply for better understanding
- Research rending engine options (OpenGL, Vulkan)
