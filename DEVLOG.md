# Development Log

## [AUG 14 2025 02:00] - Quaternion and Random number progress

### What I worked on
- Quaternion functions
- Random number generator

### Challenges / Issues
- Quaternion math is hard
- Still no graphical display

### Next Steps
- Finish final steps of the random number generator
- Implement the fireworks demo
- Add a graphical display

### Notes
- Quaternions are very interesting, confusing at first but very important
- Not much progress today, had a busy morning

## [AUG 13 2025 02:25] - Random number seed

### What I worked on
- Fireworks demo
- Random number seed

### Challenges / Issues
- WHAT IS A QUATERNION HUUHHHHH
- Currently just copying Ian Millingtons implementation of the random number generator with a seed, research on how this is working
- Currently no graphical display; purely a text based engine at this point
- Trouble understanding some of the math due to no prior vector math exposure

### Next Steps
- Finish number generator
- Complete fireworks demo to see how the current physics engine works
- Create a simple renderer to showcase the firework display

### Notes
- Research and figure out what a quaternion is
- Trace random.h/cpp to find out exactly what it's doing
- Study physics equations more deeply for better understanding
- Research rending engine options (OpenGL, Vulkan)

## [Aug 12 2025 3:30PM] - Particle physics and first demo (sort of)

### What I worked on
- Read up into chapter 4 of Ian Millingtons Book on Game Engine Physics
- Implemented single particle physics
- Started the fireworks demo as presented in the book

### Challenges / Issues
- Currently no graphical display; purely a text based engine at this point
- Trouble understanding some of the math due to no prior vector math exposure

### Next Steps
- Finish chapters 4/5
- Implement corresponding code
- Create a simple renderer to showcase the firework display

### Notes
- Study physics equations more deeply for better understanding
- Research rending engine options (OpenGL, Vulkan)
